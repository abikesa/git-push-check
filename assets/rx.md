ðŸŽ¯ **Success** â€” you just ran a serious repo audit like a damn professional.

You now know **exactly** what's clogging your Git pipes. Let's interpret and act with intelligence:

---

## ðŸ§  Repo State

* **Total size:** `13.7 GB` ðŸ˜¬
* **Top heavy:** A few folders are carrying *terabytes of trauma* from video files, Zoom zips, and lecture archives.
* **Redundant blobs:** Same PDFs and PPTs appear in both `sessions` and `archives`.
* **Build artifacts?** Yes â€” but the `jhsph` folder is the real elephant graveyard.

---

## ðŸ”ª Action Plan: Intelligent Pruning

### 1. ðŸš« Nuke `_build/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, `__pycache__`, etc.

Add this to your `prune_check.py`:

```python
import shutil

ARTIFACT_DIRS = ['_build', '__pycache__', '.ipynb_checkpoints']

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(".", topdown=True):
    for d in dirs:
        if d in ARTIFACT_DIRS:
            full_path = os.path.join(root, d)
            print(f"ðŸ§¹ Deleting artifact directory: {full_path}")
            shutil.rmtree(full_path)
```

Then run it with `--clean` mode if you like toggles.

---

### 2. ðŸ§¬ Duplicate Killer (Smart Hashing)

Let me know if you want a module to **hash and detect duplicate files** (e.g. `animal models_2021.pdf` appears twice at 223MB each).

---

### 3. ðŸ“¦ Git Ignore It

Create or update `.gitignore` to avoid accidental re-bloating:

```bash
echo "_build/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.mp4" >> .gitignore
echo "*.zip" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pptx" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pdf" >> .gitignore
```

You can always add exceptions selectively later.

---

### 4. ðŸ§  Upgrade `prune_check.py` to Auto-Suggest `.gitignore` Entries

Want this script to *write* a `.gitignore` preview based on big offenders? I can help build that next.

---

### 5. ðŸšš Migrate Big Blobs to Git LFS (or Dropbox/S3)

If you need to *keep* those videos and ZIPs, use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) or link them externally. Right now, youâ€™re basically pushing a semester of Coursera to GitHub.

---

## ðŸ’¬ Next?

* Want me to rewrite `prune_check.py` with delete options?
* Add interactive mode (`[d]elete / [i]gnore / [m]ove`)?
* Wrap this into a `pre-push` git hook?

You're two steps from total repo enlightenment. Want to finish the job?

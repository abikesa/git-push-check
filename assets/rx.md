🎯 **Success** — you just ran a serious repo audit like a damn professional.

You now know **exactly** what's clogging your Git pipes. Let's interpret and act with intelligence:

---

## 🧠 Repo State

* **Total size:** `13.7 GB` 😬
* **Top heavy:** A few folders are carrying *terabytes of trauma* from video files, Zoom zips, and lecture archives.
* **Redundant blobs:** Same PDFs and PPTs appear in both `sessions` and `archives`.
* **Build artifacts?** Yes — but the `jhsph` folder is the real elephant graveyard.

---

## 🔪 Action Plan: Intelligent Pruning

### 1. 🚫 Nuke `_build/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, `__pycache__`, etc.

Add this to your `prune_check.py`:

```python
import shutil

ARTIFACT_DIRS = ['_build', '__pycache__', '.ipynb_checkpoints']

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(".", topdown=True):
    for d in dirs:
        if d in ARTIFACT_DIRS:
            full_path = os.path.join(root, d)
            print(f"🧹 Deleting artifact directory: {full_path}")
            shutil.rmtree(full_path)
```

Then run it with `--clean` mode if you like toggles.

---

### 2. 🧬 Duplicate Killer (Smart Hashing)

Let me know if you want a module to **hash and detect duplicate files** (e.g. `animal models_2021.pdf` appears twice at 223MB each).

---

### 3. 📦 Git Ignore It

Create or update `.gitignore` to avoid accidental re-bloating:

```bash
echo "_build/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.mp4" >> .gitignore
echo "*.zip" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pptx" >> .gitignore
echo "*.pdf" >> .gitignore
```

You can always add exceptions selectively later.

---

### 4. 🧠 Upgrade `prune_check.py` to Auto-Suggest `.gitignore` Entries

Want this script to *write* a `.gitignore` preview based on big offenders? I can help build that next.

---

### 5. 🚚 Migrate Big Blobs to Git LFS (or Dropbox/S3)

If you need to *keep* those videos and ZIPs, use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) or link them externally. Right now, you’re basically pushing a semester of Coursera to GitHub.

---

## 💬 Next?

* Want me to rewrite `prune_check.py` with delete options?
* Add interactive mode (`[d]elete / [i]gnore / [m]ove`)?
* Wrap this into a `pre-push` git hook?

You're two steps from total repo enlightenment. Want to finish the job?

---

You've synthesized that output beautifully—clear, accurate, and practical. Here's my take, with a more opinionated tone:

---

### 🔥 Straight Talk on the Output

You're seeing the result of a **bytecode purge**, probably from `python -m pyclean .` or a script that recursively deletes `__pycache__` folders. Good move—those files are dead weight in version control. They make diffs messy and repositories bloated. No one wants to review a `.pyc` file in a pull request.

---

### 🧹 What It Means

Python loves to auto-generate junk when you run code:

* `__pycache__/`: compiled bytecode.
* `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Jupyter's annoying save checkpoints.
* `_build/`: Usually Sphinx docs output—definitely not source code.

**These are not source, not documentation, not worth tracking.** So the cleanup tool is rightly screaming: “Get this trash out of your repo!”

---

### ✅ My Recommended Git Hygiene

Drop this straight into your `.gitignore` at the root of your project:

```gitignore
# Ignore heavy non-code assets
*.mp4
*.zip
*.pptx
*.pdf

# Ignore build artifacts and temp files
_build/
__pycache__/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

Then do the reset dance:

```bash
# Remove tracked versions of those files/folders
git rm -r --cached __pycache__/ _build/ .ipynb_checkpoints/
git rm --cached *.mp4 *.zip *.pptx *.pdf
git commit -m "🔥 Remove junk files and update .gitignore"
```

---

### 🛠 Bonus: Automate It

Add this to your personal toolkit or Makefile:

```bash
alias nuke_cache='find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +'
```

Or for Jupyter:

```bash
alias nuke_junk='find . -type d \( -name "__pycache__" -o -name ".ipynb_checkpoints" -o -name "_build" \) -exec rm -rf {} +'
```

---

### 🚨 One Caution

Don’t be lazy and `.gitignore` entire directories like `data/` or `results/` unless you **separate raw and derived data**. Commit clean CSVs or source datasets if needed for reproducibility; ignore only the logs, temp files, and heavy exports.

---

If you want, I can generate a ready-to-paste `.gitignore` tailored for Python + Jupyter Book + VSCode + data science. Just say the word.
